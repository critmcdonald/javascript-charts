# The basics of Javascript charts

## Re-work this to be simpler ... not four steps, but concentrate on just the chart.

GOAL: To give students a basic understanding of how JavaScript charting tools work, so they can learn and explore in the future.

When you want to learn more, there are plenty of online tutorials:

* W3Schools HTML
* W3Schools CSS
* W3Schools JavaScript

To use JavaScript charting tools, you need to have the basic understanding of the code behind the modern-day website: HTML, CSS and Javascript.

I explain how these work together through an analogy of the human body:

* HTML (Hypertext Markup Language, but no one calls it that) is the skeleton. It's is the underlying structure of a web page, holding all the parts together.
* CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the skin and DNA of the body, defining the color and shape of all the bones underneath.
* JavaScript is the muscles and brain. It controls the movement and functionality.

At their most basic levels, they are not difficult to understand. CSS and Javascript can get complex quickly.
